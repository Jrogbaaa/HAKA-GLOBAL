**Landing Page**:

**We support Personal and Corporate Affairs** with anticipation, strategic clarity, access and long-term vision. We operate where decisions take shape, before they become public.

We read context, influence outcomes and position people and companies where it matters most. Strategy, reputation and capital move together.

We create opinions and build consensus.

We advise with clarity. We invest with conviction. We act with access.

**Pre-Shift Strike** is not a slogan. It’s knowing when to move, where to stand, and who needs to be in the room. Before the shift happens.

**ABOUT HAKA**

**Anticipation · Affairs · Influence**

HAKA operates where **decisions take shape**, before they become public or formalized.

We work within complex **personal, corporate and institutional environments**, supporting individuals and organizations whose outcomes depend on **context, alignment and timing**, not only on market dynamics.

Our activity sits within **Personal and Corporate Affairs**: the management of positioning, relationships and credibility in environments where **power, interests and perception converge.**

We help navigate groups of influence, shape alignment among key actors and **build consensus before positions harden**. Influence, for us, is not pressure — it is strategic alignment achieved early.

Anticipation defines our advantage. By combining contextual judgment with **AI-driven strategic intelligence**, we analyze decision-making environments, identify early signals and anticipate scenarios before they become visible.

This allows our clients to move:

	•	before narratives settle,

	•	before consensus becomes public,

	•	before the shift occurs.

**Pre-Shift Strike** is how we operate. HAKA works selectively and with discretion. We do not seek visibility. We operate where relevance is decided.

**AI as Strategic Leverage**

At HAKA, artificial intelligence is not a product, a toolset or a standalone service.

It is a **strategic leverage layer** embedded into our judgment and advisory processes. We use AI to enhance contextual analysis, map complex decision-making environments, detect weak signals and simulate scenarios before they materialize. The objective is not automation, but **clarity**: reducing uncertainty, improving timing and supporting higher-quality decisions at critical moments. AI amplifies human judgment. It does not replace it.

Investment Philosophy

We do not chase trends. We position capital before they form.

Our approach combines contextual intelligence, disciplined risk assessment and access to non-obvious opportunities.

Conviction matters more than volume.

⸻

**Investment Areas**

**1\. Worldwide Real Estate**

Strategic real estate investments across key global locations, focused on scarcity, positioning and long-term relevance rather than short-term cycles.

⸻

**2\. Private & Strategic Investments**

Direct investments in companies and structures where governance, strategy and long-term vision are aligned.

This includes access to startups and early-stage opportunities typically unavailable to the broader market, sourced through private networks and proprietary intelligence.

⸻

**3\. Precious Metals**

Targeted exposure to precious metals as instruments of capital preservation, optionality and portfolio balance, approached with strategic timing and discipline.

⸻

**4\. Luxury Assets & Collectibles**

We treat luxury goods as investment-grade assets, driven by scarcity, demand and access.

We provide sourcing, access and resale of highly sought-after and often inaccessible pieces, including watches, handbags, accessories and fine jewelry from maisons such as Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Rolex, Hermès, Chanel, Goyard, and other highly selective brands. We operate where access defines value.

⸻

**Intelligence & Timing**

Investment decisions are supported by AI-driven strategic intelligence, applied to context analysis, scenario anticipation and decision support across market and non-market environments.

⸻

**How We Operate**

Direct investments or mandate-based activity. No open vehicles. No mass exposure.

Discretion and selectivity are fundamental.

⸻

Capital follows insight. insight comes before opportunity.
